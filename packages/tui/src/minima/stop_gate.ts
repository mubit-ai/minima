/**
 * Stop-gate (A2) — the run-level complement to the per-step done-gate.
 *
 * The per-step done-gate (`bigPlanHooks.before`) refuses a `todowrite` that marks ONE step
 * `completed` while its `verify` fails. It cannot, however, stop the agent from simply ENDING the
 * run — going quiet with no more tool calls — while the plan still has unfinished or failing steps.
 * This module fills that gap by hanging off the loop's one terminal seam, `shouldStopAfterTurn`
 * (agent/loop.ts:155), which fires after every settled turn.
 *
 * The rule (all reads off the ledger — no checks are re-run here):
 *   - A turn that still requests tools is NOT a stop attempt → let the loop continue.
 *   - The plan is "not done" when any step is not `completed`, OR a completed step's latest gate
 *     row has `outcome === "failed"`. (`unrunnable` is an environment error, never a block — the
 *     same conservative stance the recovery ladder takes.)
 *   - While strikes remain, a stop attempt on a not-done plan is DENIED: a firm continuation
 *     message is pushed into `state.followUp` (so the loop re-drives the model instead of breaking)
 *     and a strike is spent.
 *   - Once `maxStrikes` denials are spent, the harness stops fighting the agent and ASKS: in an
 *     interactive run it raises the question overlay (keep going / accept as done / freetext steer);
 *     headless (no ask channel) it just lets the run end. Either way a single audit-only `stop`
 *     gate row is written.
 *
 * Enforcement lives here (harness code at a turn boundary), not in prompt text — per the
 * "enforcement in the dispatcher, guidance in the prompt" principle. Everything is gated by
 * `config.bigPlan` + `config.stopStrikes > 0` at the call site (runtime.ts); this module is
 * inert unless wired in. Fail-open throughout: any ledger error assesses as "not blocked" so a
 * broken read can never wedge the loop.
